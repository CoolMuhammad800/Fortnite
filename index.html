    <h3>Info</h3>
    <p>Fortnite is an online video game developed by Epic Games and released in 2017. It is available in three distinct game mode versions that otherwise share the same general gameplay and game engine: Fortnite Battle Royale, a free-to-play battle royale game in which up to 100 players fight to be the last person standing; Fortnite: Save the World, a cooperative hybrid tower defense-shooter and survival game in which up to four players fight off zombie-like creatures and defend objects with traps and fortifications they can build; and Fortnite Creative, in which players are given complete freedom to create worlds and battle arenas.</p>

    <h3>How to Play</h3>
    
    <p>Taking on board some advice for how to play Fortnite before you book a trip to the battle royale island can help you to become suitably prepared, particularly if this is your first visit there. You probably have a rough idea of how this genre works already, with the goal being to outlast all other players to become the last one standing, but there's much more going on. With a number of mechanics and systems to learn there's plenty to get to grips with, but putting in the time will pay off in the long run and increase your chances of earning a Victory Royale. I appreciate that it can feel intimidating to arrive as a fresh player, especially when there are others out there with years of experience already under their belts, but if you give it a good go then you may discover Fortnite is the game for you.</p>
